## Joe Rogan Motivator App 

I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a big fan of the JRE podcast. Joe has some interesting points on topics and some really, really cool guests.

He is also a straight talker and has a lot of really motivating and since I've just learnt all about API's, Fetch and Async/Await, I'm going to try my hand to build a JRE motivation app. 

For those days that coding can get tough and you need a 52 tattooed bald man to give you a "don't be a bitch" pep talk. Lovely, let's get into it.

1. ~Commit app to Github~
2. Build UI
3. Get assets (images, soundbites, favicon)
4. Decide if I want to keep it local or deploy to Herkou 
5. Build out HTTP librar
